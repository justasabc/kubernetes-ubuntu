    ;; Enable localization by setting this to a value other than 0.

    ;; localization data expires. The default value is 0 which disables
    ;; all localizations and uses the English default.

    ;; account creation e-mails.
    ;; This is used only when localization is enabled.

    ;; Log warnings about missing translations.
    ;; This is mainly useful for identifying demand for new translations
    ;; or for debugging localization resources. Default setting is 1.
    ;; 0 disables all warnings about missing translations.
    ;; 1 warns about phrases without translations in any of the available
    ;;   languages.
    ;; 2 additionally warns when phrases can not be translated into one or
    ;;   more of the languages requested by a user.
